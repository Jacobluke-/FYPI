        "At this point, we have seen various feed-forward networks. That is, there is no state maintained by the network at all. This might not be the behavior we want. Sequence models are central to NLP: they are models where there is some sort of dependence through time between your inputs. The classical example of a sequence model is the Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging. Another example is the conditional random field.\n",
        "\n",
        "A recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of state. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input, so that information can propogate along as the network passes over the sequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence, there is a corresponding *hidden state* $ h_t $​, which in principle can contain information from arbitrary points earlier in the sequence. We can use the hidden state to predict words in a language model, part-of-speech tags, and a myriad of other things.\n"
